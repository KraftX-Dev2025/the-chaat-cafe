Prompt - 1 : I want to create a restaurant landing page website which will give info about the chaat cafe brand, the color theme is black and yellow. View all the images and references given below.

Prompt - 2 : From the above 3 images, modify the banner page, shift all the text to lhs for desktop devices and add 2 images one will be moving up and down 30-40 pixels and other will be still with a unique shape as shown in the first image, create a menu bar to show text details, restaurant timings, navigation only for mobile devices, for now keep the website only single page, later we will make it multi paged website and add more funtionalities. Add one more page for menu in the home papge to display the menu as shown in the image-3. The image-1 and image-2 are the references for the banner page and image-3 is for the menu page. Modify the footer page same as the footer.png image, add a circular image on the lhs, social media links, useful links, favourite dishes links and news letter input.
